## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (or VS Code with C# extension)
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server 2019+ or SQL Server Express
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PECCI_HRIS
```

### Step 2: Configure Database Connection

Open `appsettings.json` and update the connection string:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=PECCI_HRIS_DB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

**Common formats:**
- Local SQL Express: `Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;...`
- Named instance: `Server=YOUR_PC_NAME\\SQLEXPRESS;...`
- SQL Auth: `Server=localhost;Database=PECCI_HRIS_DB;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword;TrustServerCertificate=True;`

### Step 3: Restore NuGet Packages
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Step 4: Run Migrations

**Via Package Manager Console (Visual Studio):**
```powershell
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

This will:
- Create the `PECCI_HRIS_DB` database
- Create all tables
- Seed default data (roles, admin user, departments, leave types, system settings)

### Step 5: (Optional) Add Sample Data

Open SSMS, connect to your server, and run:
```sql
-- File: Database/01_Seed_Data.sql
```

This adds sample employees and leave credits for testing.

### Step 6: Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

Or press **F5** in Visual Studio.

Navigate to: `https://localhost:5001` (or the port shown in the console)

### Step 7: Login

**Default credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Admin@123`

> ⚠️ **Change this password immediately after first login!**

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Accounts (after running seed data)
- **HR Admin:** `admin` / `Admin@123`
- **Sample Employees:** EMP-0001 to EMP-0005 (create user accounts via User Management)

### Test Scenarios
1. **Attendance:**
   - Time in at 08:05:00 → On time
   - Time in at 08:05:01 → Late (1 minute from 08:00)
   - Time out after 17:30 → Overtime credited (if ≥30 min)
2. **Leave:**
   - Apply for leave → Manager approves → HR approves → Credits deducted
3. **Payroll:**
   - Compute payroll for a cutoff → Verify tax, SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG
   - Generate payslip PDF
